### others' opinions.
[Arkäne](/av-archive/arkane)'s: The famed matched set, I see. One creates whatever madness the other brews in the cauldron. Though I _suppose_ one of them at least acknowledges the lack of sanity present. Small mercies."

[Meadr](/av-archive/meadr)'s: "If trouble were a person—or rather, two people—I do believe we'd have found them. They could weaponize their combined energy if they ever stopped bickering long enough to focus. Small mercies indeed that they don't. Still, their enthusiasm is … refreshing. In measured doses."

[Rhezua](/av-archive/rhezua)'s: "The illustrious Eldrathyn twin. How curious that they flaunt eccentricity so openly. It must be delightful to have no reputation worth upholding. Still, I suppose such unchecked vitality has its uses, if only as a cautionary tale for those of us with any sense of restraint."

[Dain](/av-archive/dain)'s: "Strange, how both of them enter rooms as softly as misplaced thoughts, yet announce themselves as loudly as an avalanche. I’d be impressed if it weren’t so inconvenient when one is trying to read."
