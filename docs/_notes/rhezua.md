A name you may know, though I advise against assuming you understand its weight. I lend my talents to the study of Air Mysth, not idle gossip. If you seek favor, come with leverage. If you seek debate, come prepared. And if you mistake my patience for pliancy? That would be ... unwise."</div>

[[arkane]]'s comment: "A mind as sharp as her fan, though I suspect her wit cuts deeper when she's not busy calculating how best to wield her family name like a ceremonial dagger. At least she's competent. More than I can say for half the nobility milling about here."

[[meadr]]'s comment: "Rhezua is… formidable, isn't she? Like a perfectly sharpened quill—precise, elegant, and capable of drawing blood if you misplace your trust. I admire her efficiency. And her ability to freeze an entire room with a single raised brow. Though I do wonder if she ever tires of lifting it so often."

[[dain]]'s comment: "Her presence feels … *calculated*, like she's already planned three conversations ahead, and ensured she’s winning all of them. But there's something … almost rehearsed about it all. Like she's playing a role she can't stop performing."

[[owain & elowen]]'s comment: "A storm wrapped in silk, all grandeur and no thunder; how terribly exhausting to maintain!" - "Mm, but what delightful chaos she would unleash if ever she stopped trying so *hard* to be feared."
