<p><a href="/av-archive/arkane">Arkäne</a>’s comment: “Ah, the elusive ghost of Arx. One who has the peculiar habit of vanishing from memory the moment you turn your back. Most can’t recall his face, but I suppose I have a marginally better memory. Or perhaps he’s just terrible at illusions.”</p>

<p><a href="/av-archive/meadr">Meadr</a>’s comment: “Quiet sort, but sharp when he speaks. Writes poetry, I think? Strange how people overlook him, almost as if he slips through their thoughts like mist. Then again, perhaps he prefers it that way. … Odd, though. Arkäne seems to notice him out of a crowd without even trying.”</p>

<p><a href="/av-archive/rhezua">Rhezua</a>’s comment: “The … inconspicuous one, from Elyvon, was it? Or perhaps I’m mistaken. Quiet to the point of near nonexistence. One wonders what purpose such anonymity serves. I vaguely recall his poetry being somewhat tolerable.”</p>

<p><a href="/av-archive/owain&amp;elowen">Owain &amp; Elowen</a>’s comments: “A most peculiar fellow. Passed me thrice one morn, yet I swear the corridor was empty! … What color was his hair again?” - “Oh, the one who writes poetry … or was it alchemy? By the Obottá, my memory fails me.”</p>
