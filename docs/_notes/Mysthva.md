<p align="justify">Mysthvá, a world where an ambient essence called <strong>Mysth</strong> fuels everything, from elemental chanting to advanced Mysth-tech. Its skies are lit by two moons (Dlėcv and Ylōcv), its landscapes range from sentient forests to deserts beneath mirror-like clouds, and its societies teem with opulent nobles, persecuted demihumans (part-human hybrids), Mysth beings (*among them mythical & mythological, and fabricated one*), and ancient guardian spirits like Obottá, who protect ley lines—natural conduits of Mysth. </p>

<p align="justify">Here, chanters wield fire, water, or other elements through incantations, or bonds with Mysth creatures, while others rely on Mysth-powered crafts, all amid tensions between tradition and progress, hidden abilities, and deep-rooted prejudices.</p>
