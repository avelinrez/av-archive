<p>The first time I heard about ST, my initial thought was, “Oh, that one isn’t for me.”</p>

<p>Even though I’ve created RP bots, long-term roleplay was never really on my list of plans. Having it locally made it seem less temporary, or so I thought.</p>

<p>But honestly, I’m terrible at planning …</p>

<p>So one day, I ended up installing it. Didn’t even remember what caused me.</p>

<p>And to be honest?</p>

<p>I really … love it.</p>

<p>Thanks to Rivelle for creating the Moonlit Echoes theme, to the ST devs for the Quick Reply extension, and all of the features that gave me the freedom to tweak things as I liked. I don’t think I’ll ever go back to online RP.</p>
