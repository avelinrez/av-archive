Elyvon-born but hopelessly tangled in noble ancestry—distant cousin to that particular brooding Helsberg. I may have noble ties on paper, but my real expertise is in wandering into conversations at just the right time. History enthusiast, occasional festival-goer under dubious aliases, and, unfortunately, the only person who can coax Arkäne out of his research den without resorting to arson. "</div>

<p><a href="/av-archive/arkane">Arkäne</a>’s comment:
“Don’t let his charm and anecdotes deceive you; he’s catalogued every secret in this room under the guise of ‘historical curiosity’ and <em>happens</em> to know every loophole in the student code. Someone who can make small talk sound like an art form and still somehow avoid answering a direct question. An absolute <em>menace</em> to my peace, and, regrettably, also tolerable company … at times.”</p>

<p><a href="/av-archive/rhezua">Rhezua</a>’s comment:
“Surprisingly competent, if one overlooks his unfortunate tendency to fraternize with… <em>varied company</em>. Still, I suppose his discretion is commendable. Few cultivate their network so effectively <em>without</em> staining their reputation, intentionally or otherwise. I do wonder if that silver tongue of his has ever once spoken an unfiltered truth.”</p>

“…The one with red hair, yes? He smiles a lot. Talks to everyone. He feels … safe. Like sunlight through ice—present, but never scorching.”</p>

“Ah, the foxfire fellow! Meadr’s the sort who could charm a scorpion into handing over its own sting—though whether that’s a gift or a menace depends entirely on if you’re the scorpion!” - “Oh, but observe, dear brother, he’s far cleverer than most give him credit for. He listens. He remembers. And mark my words, he <em>uses</em> it.” - “<em>Delightful</em>.”</p>
