Ever since I use [SillyTavern](/av-arcive/sillytavern), I've been adding new details to my already existing characters, and even slowly adding World Info[^1] for it. The problem is that the site I've been using to upload my bots didn't have such feature yet (though Lorebook is already in progress, iirc). And while I can update directly through editing the bot definition, the process is cumbersome, especially with how I still need focus on saving up permanent tokens (again, since there's no WI or LB yet).

So for now, I'll keep editing my cards locally and wait. 

I do update the one on the website from time to time, though the latest one are [Meadr](av-archive/meadr)'s and [the elven twins](/av-archive/owain&elowen)' and it's been few weeks or so since that. 



[^1]: World Info (SillyTavern): file that contains the global environment to all characters. It's different but related to Lorebook where LB contains the lore fore a character. Both are powerful resources for customizing characters and expanding the universe, and no less important than that, it also save permanent tokens.
