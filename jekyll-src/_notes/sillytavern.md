The first time I heard about ST[^1], my initial thought was, "Oh, that one isn’t for me."

Even though I’ve created RP bots, long-term roleplay was never really on my list of plans. Having it locally made it seem less temporary, or so I thought.

But honestly, I’m terrible at planning ...

So one day, I ended up installing it. Didn't even remember what caused me.

And to be honest? 

I really … love it.

Thanks to Rivelle for creating the Moonlit Echoes theme[^2], to the ST devs for the Quick Reply extension, and all of the features that gave me the freedom to tweak things as I liked. I don't think I'll ever go back to online RP.
