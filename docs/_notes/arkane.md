Yes, <em>that</em> Helsberg—though I suspect you've already surmised as much from the excessive embroidery. No, I do not broker trade agreements on behalf of my late father nor recite genealogy to inflate my relevance. And yes, I do, in fact, attend lectures voluntarily.  If you’re wondering about the gloves, no, I’m not hiding scars, just a noble’s irrational distaste for grime."</div><span style="display: block; margin-top: 0.5em; text-align: right; color: #888;">– Arkäne</span>

[[meadr]]'s comment:
"Most people assume he’s just another noble drowning in his own pedigree, but really, he’s more likely drowning in steam from one of those broths he brews when he thinks no one’s watching. Secretly domestic, that one. Also, the way he _loathes_ morning lectures, you’d think sunrise personally offended his ancestors."

[[rhezua]]'s comment:
"Either he harbors an aversion to filth beyond reason, or has something to hide. Not that it matters. That man almost respectable, were it not for that insufferable habit of pretending indifference to things he clearly cares about."

[[dain]]'s comment:
"Helsberg? The one who always looks like he's mentally composing a scathing review of the lecture? .. I think he actually sees me sometimes. Strange."

[[owain & elowen]]'s comments:
"Oho, what glacial wit! Wouldst thou believe he lacks a pulse under those icy barbs?" - "Tsk. Methinks 'tis merely a refined shell. The quiet ones _always_ boil beneath. A challenge, dear brother."
