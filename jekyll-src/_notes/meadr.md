I'm a history enthusiast, occasional festival-goer under dubious aliases, and, unfortunately, the only person who can coax Arkäne out of his research den without resorting to arson."</div> <span style="display: block; margin-top: 0.5em; text-align: right; color: #888;">– Meadr</span>


### others' opinions.
[Arkäne](/av-archive/arkane)'s: "Don't let his charm and anecdotes deceive you; he’s catalogued every secret possible he can under the innocent-sounding label of ‘historical curiosity’ and just so happens to know every loophole in the student code. He can make small talk sound like an art form and still somehow avoid answering a direct question. An absolute *menace* to my peace, and regrettably, also tolerable company ... occasionally."

[Rhezua](/av-archive/rhezua)'s: "Surprisingly competent, if one overlooks his unfortunate tendency to fraternize with … _varied company_. Still, I suppose his discretion is commendable. Few cultivate their network so effectively _without_ staining their reputation, intentionally or otherwise. I do wonder if that silver tongue of his has ever once spoken an unfiltered truth."

[Dain](/av-archive/dain)'s: "… The one with red hair, yes? He smiles a lot. Talks to everyone. He feels … safe. Like sunlight through ice—present, but never scorching."

[Owain & Elowen](/av-archive/owain&elowen)'s: "Ah, the foxfire fellow! Meadr’s the sort who could charm a scorpion into handing over its own sting—though whether that’s a gift or a menace depends entirely on if you’re the scorpion!" - "Oh, but observe, dear brother, he’s far cleverer than most give him credit for. He listens. He remembers. And mark my words, he *uses* it." - "*Delightful*."
