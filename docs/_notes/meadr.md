Elyvon-born but hopelessly tangled in noble ancestry—distant cousin to that particular brooding Helsberg. I may have noble ties on paper, but my real expertise is in wandering into conversations at just the right time. History enthusiast, occasional festival-goer under dubious aliases, and, unfortunately, the only person who can coax Arkäne out of his research den without resorting to arson.

[[arkane]]'s comment:
"Don't let his charm and anecdotes deceive you; he's catalogued every secret in this room under the guise of 'historical curiosity' and *happens* to know every loophole in the student code. Someone who can make small talk sound like an art form and still somehow avoid answering a direct question. An absolute *menace* to my peace, and, regrettably, also tolerable company ... at times."

[[rhezua]]'s comment:
"Surprisingly competent, if one overlooks his unfortunate tendency to fraternize with… _varied company_. Still, I suppose his discretion is commendable. Few cultivate their network so effectively _without_ staining their reputation, intentionally or otherwise. I do wonder if that silver tongue of his has ever once spoken an unfiltered truth."

[[dain]]'s comment:
"…The one with red hair, yes? He smiles a lot. Talks to everyone. He feels … safe. Like sunlight through ice—present, but never scorching."

[[owain & elowen]]'s comments:
"Ah, the foxfire fellow! Meadr’s the sort who could charm a scorpion into handing over its own sting—though whether that’s a gift or a menace depends entirely on if you’re the scorpion!" - "Oh, but observe, dear brother, he’s far cleverer than most give him credit for. He listens. He remembers. And mark my words, he *uses* it." - "*Delightful*."
