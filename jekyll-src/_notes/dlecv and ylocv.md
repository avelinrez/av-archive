Dlėcv and Ylōcv are Mysthvá’s twin moons, who, according to some cultural interpretation, are like celestial siblings with opposing temperaments.
- **Dlėcv**: The brighter, steady moon. Its light bathes the land in silvery-blue hues, and it’s associated with stability, clarity, and the stern but fair guardian of the physical realm. Some cultures revere it as a symbol of justice.
- **Ylōcv**: The quieter, subtler moon, glowing faintly with an amber tinge. It’s tied to intuition, secrets, and the unseen, rumored to influence dreams and hidden Mysth currents. Legends paint it as a trickster or a keeper of forbidden knowledge. Shadow chanters and fortune-tellers often work under its light.

There are some important celestial happens related to these:
1. **Dual/Twin Full**: happens once a year when both moons are full at the same time. The sky gets flooded with silvery-blue light, and Mysth gets supercharged. For most people, it’s a time of celebration or powerful Mysth. But for [Niam](/av-archive/niam), it’s deeply personal: it’s the only time her father wakes up from his coma. She uses the energy to try healing him, even if just a little.
2. **Moons’ Wane**: This is when the moons naturally fade during their monthly cycles. It’s less dramatic than an eclipse, but still significant. Demihumans’ powers weaken, and some tribes, like Lahni’s, become extra cautious. For [Lahni](/av-archive/lahni), it’s a bitter reminder of her betrothed Kohn’s death, which happened during a wane when demihumans were vulnerable.
3. **Dual/Twin Eclipse**: This is rare and way more ominous. Both moons line up perfectly and block each other out, plunging the world into darkness. Mysth vanishes completely. Leylines freeze, enchanted items stop working, and demihumans like [Meadr](/av-archive/meadr) can’t hide their true forms anymore. Cultures see it as a bad omen. For the Howells ([Keus](/av-archive/keus) and his mother Serafina), though, it’s a time of twisted celebration. Serafina leans into the darkness, believing it strengthens their cursed bloodline.
