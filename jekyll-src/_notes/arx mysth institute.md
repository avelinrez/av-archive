<p align="justify">Arx Mysth Institute is a renowned academy nestled in a valley protected by shifting Mysth wards, where students harness Mysth—to master their natural elemental forces, bond with elusive creatures, or forge new inventions, or any other passion projects across departments, from Elemental Enchantment to Mysth-Engineering Artificery.</p>

<p align="justify">It's a place where traditions like weekly temple rituals collide with clandestine trips to monthly town festivals, all amid simmering tensions between noble-born purists, ambitious commoners, Mysth beings and demihumans hiding their bloodlines. Its annual Chanter Tournament draws royals and guilds scouting talent, while graduation hinges on either completing examination after turning 20 or pioneering a groundbreaking Mysth project under the watch of researcher-professors.</p>
