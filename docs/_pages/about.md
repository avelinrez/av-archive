**Av is just a made-up name, obviously.** 

Sometimes I go by <span style="background: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 60%, #FF5582A6 50%);">Avelin</span> or <span style="background: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 60%, #ADCCFFA6 50%);">Avelio</span>, but I could be something else entirely. 

Maybe I'm even your neighbor down the road? 

You wouldn't know either way.

...

Too many interests swirling in my head. Too little time and money.

If I'm gone, then it's probably because I am deep into another projects, or life is drowning me. 

Almost no in-between.
